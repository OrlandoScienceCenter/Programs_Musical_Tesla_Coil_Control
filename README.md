So this control system was originally designed to work with the small Tesla Coil on the floor.Unfortunately, due to EMI/RFI interfearance from the tesla coil's discarge, the Arduino was unable to function reliably. 

This might be a good set of code to try later with another exhibit needing a timing/reset function, or perhaps a tesla coil with a solid state drive.
